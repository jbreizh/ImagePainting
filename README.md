# imagePaintingSTA

Yet another project on LightPainting ....
Existing project on the topic like Adafruit [NeoPixel Painter](https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixel-painter/overview) or [Light Painting with Raspberry Pi](https://learn.adafruit.com/light-painting-with-raspberry-pi/overview) are great and have been a great source of inspiration/information, but i find those to complicated and unpractical on the field. You need to much hardware and you can't be far from your computer to load other image or tweet parameters.

My project is base on hardware and use simplicity. All you need is an APA102 led strip, an ESP8266 and a webbrowser (computer of course but mainly smartphone).

### Hardware Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Software Prerequisites


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```
